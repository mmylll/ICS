1. Overview
***********

This directory contains the source files for the Proxy Lab driver
program, called driver.sh. The proxy driver runs the student's Web
proxy and a precompiled version of the Tiny Web server as child
processes, and then tests the proxy by sending it HTTP GET requests
for the Tiny server.

The driver performs three basic tests:

1. Basic Correctness (40 points)

The driver fetches five files directly from Tiny and stores them in
the .noproxy directory. Then it fetches the same five files via the
proxy and stores them in the .proxy directory. It awards 8 points for
each pair of matching files.

2. Concurrency (15 points)

The driver does a simple test for head of line blocking. first
establishes an idle connection with the proxy. If the proxy isn't
concurrent it is now blocked from accepting other connections. The
driver then attempts to fetch a file via the proxy.

3. Caching (15 points)

The driver fetches some files from Tiny via the proxy, kills Tiny,
then attempts the same files from Tiny via the proxy.
